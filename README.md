# Iterated_FIR_Filter
Compare a direct implementation of a Narrow Bandwidth FIR Filter with a large Sample Rate to bandwidth ratio to an Iterated Design that implements the Narrowband Filter at a reduced sample rate and then interpolates up to the higher sample rate. The initial design is a FIR filter designed with a Kaiser Windowed Sinc filter.
